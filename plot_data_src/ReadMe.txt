plot_data.py asks for a location of a local text file conataining X, Y values. Also you have the option
of using the Random_XY program to generate those text files yourself.

Once you have a text file you can then plot the points once with a green Python turtle, then again in blue
with a formula applied which will cause all the points to line up in a angle relative to the points.
