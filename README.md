plot_data.py is the main file.

plot_data runs from the command line and asks the user for a text file containing X,Y coordinates.
Once a file path and name is entered it then plots the points. First it plots every point as is.
Next it applies a formula causing all the points to form a 45 degree line.

Random_XY is a helper program I wrote in Java to generate random X,Y pairs. It offers a simple user interface 
with two text areas that allow you to enter a multipler for x and a multiplier for y. Another text area for 
entering the amount of pairs you want. Lastly a button to generate all those pairs. Also there is a drop down
file menu that will allow you to save the text as a text file for use with plot_data.py
